            As one of the best Riddleman in the world, you are tasked to clear areas of the world that are infested with monsters who can only be defeated by answering their riddles. No Riddleman has yet to fully clear these areas, so each area's rewards are still unknown. It's all up to you which areas you want to clear with your riddle-solving capabilities. You'll be introduced to the specifics of the areas once you get in. Good luck, Riddleman!
